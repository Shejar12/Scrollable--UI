# 1. Scrollable Overlapping Card UI
This is a visually appealing scrollable card interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The layout features overlapping cards with smooth animations as you scroll, offering an intuitive and modern design for showcasing content.
## 2 .Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
2. git clone <repository-url>
3. Open the project directory:
  cd scrollable-card-ui
5. Open the `index.html` file in a browser:
  Open index.html in any modern web browser.

### 3. **Technology Choices and Rationale**
- **HTML:** Used to create the card structure, offering semantic and lightweight markup for content.
- **CSS:** Handles the design, including gradients, animations, and layout responsiveness.
  - CSS Transitions and Transformations provide smooth animations for scrolling interactions.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity for scrolling and managing card transitions.
  - Event listeners (e.g., `wheel`, `touchstart`, `touchend`) ensure compatibility with mouse and touch devices.
- Mention why these technologies were chosen, e.g., simplicity, performance, and browser compatibility.

### 4. **Known Limitations/Trade-offs**
- Highlight areas where the current implementation may fall short. Examples include:
  - **Performance on Older Devices:** Animations may lag on devices with limited processing power.
  - **Browser Support:** While the project uses modern CSS and JavaScript, older browsers may not fully support these features.
  - **Accessibility:** The design currently lacks ARIA roles and tab-based navigation, which may hinder usability for users relying on assistive technologies.
  - **Fixed Number of Cards:** The card layout assumes a fixed number of cards and requires manual updates if the count changes dynamically.

### 5. **Future Improvements**
- Suggest potential enhancements for the project. Examples:
  - **Accessibility Enhancements:** Add ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and improved contrast for better inclusivity.
  - **Dynamic Content Support:** Allow cards to be dynamically added or removed using JavaScript.
  - **Pagination or Infinite Scrolling:** Extend functionality to support larger datasets by dynamically loading cards.
  - **Mobile Responsiveness:** Fine-tune the layout for smaller screen sizes and test extensively across devices.
  - **Custom Themes:** Allow users to toggle between light and dark themes or apply custom color schemes.
  - **3D Effects:** Introduce 3D transformations for a more immersive experience.
